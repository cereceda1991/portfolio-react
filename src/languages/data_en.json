Each time you pressed a key, a unique drum sound was played.It was really fun working on this app. I dove into creating the UI using HTML to structure the battery elements and CSS to style them and make them look cool.Then I used vanilla JavaScript to add the key functionality of the app. It was exciting to assign specific drum sounds to each corresponding key using keyboard events. When you pressed a key, the associated sound would play, providing a fun and interactive experience.Developing this app allowed me to explore the interplay between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I really enjoyed creating a playful experience for users. I am very happy with the end result and with how much fun the development process was. I hope users enjoy playing the virtual drum kit as much as I enjoyed creating it.",

Our goal was to address the language barrier in the workplace, specifically English. Verbify offers interactive lessons, grammar exercises, vocabulary tests, and the ability to practice English conversations. Working with colleagues from different disciplines was a rewarding challenge, and I'm proud of Verbify's impact on improving English skills for better job opportunities. It was an exciting project that showcased the power of collaboration and technology.",

We use the OpenAI API to generate a variety of recipes based on simple prompts provided by the users. The app is built using the MERN stack, which includes MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. This combination allows us to create a complete and efficient web application with a flexible database, robust API, and dynamic user experience. Collaboration played a key role in the development process, leveraging the skills and knowledge of each team member. The integration of AI in CookMeal provides users with a wide range of culinary options tailored to their tastes and preferences. I'm thrilled with the final result and the potential of CookMeal to enhance the culinary experience through innovative technology and human collaboration.",
